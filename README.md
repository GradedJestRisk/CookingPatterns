# CookingPatterns

## Goal
Unveil cooking patterns in recipes.


Truth to be told, recipes are infantilizing:
"Just do exactly what I say", they say, "but don't ask questions or worry your little head about why".
They insist in fidelity and faith, but do nothing to earn or explain it.

Michael Pollan, from preface of Samin Nosrat [fundation](https://www.saltfatacidheat.com/) book
